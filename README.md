## Description
Scientific conferences are annual events that attracts researchers and scholars from around the world to share their research and ideas. In the past, paper submissions and review processes were managed using a manual system, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. This project proposal outlines the development of a web-based Conference Management System to streamline the paper submission and review process for the scientific conference.
